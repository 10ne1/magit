Magit v2.13.0 Release Notes (unreleased)
========================================

Changes since v2.12.0
---------------------

* As announced earlier, the obsolete option `magit-no-confirm-default'
  has been removed.  #3232

* Augmenting a file- or blob-visiting buffer with blame information
  was completely rewritten, making the implementation more robust and
  adding many new features.  It is now possible blame in order to get
  an answer to the question "what commits remove these lines".  It is
  no longer necessary for the buffer to be put into `read-only-mode',
  when displaying blame information.  New visualization styles were
  added and users can define their own styles.  New commands to visit
  blobs related to the current chunk were added.

* Added new command `magit-tag-release'.  This is a fairly opinionated
  command and its only use to you might be to serve as a template for
  your own variant.

* Added new section inserter `magit-insert-ignored-files', which
  could be added to `magit-status-sections-hook'.

* The mode `global-magit-file-mode' is now enabled by default, making
  the `magit-file-popup' available on "C-c M-g".  0ec28b97

* Added new commands `magit-log-trace-definition' and
  `magit-diff-trace-definition', which show a log with diffs about the
  definition at point.  #2588

* Added new commands `magit-edit-line-commit' and
  `magit-diff-edit-hunk-commit', which allow editing the commit that
  added the line at point.  febe79ba 22b13337

* The interactive prompts for the various reset commands now indicate
  the branch which is going to be reset.  #3438

* Added new option `magit-published-branches', providing an additional
  safety-net.  If you try to modify a commit that has been pushed to
  one of these branches already, then you are now being asked whether
  you really want to do that.  Do not rely on this exclusively, there
  are edge-cases that are ambiguous and are not always handled as you
  might have expected.  add4a7f3 ff

* Gravatar images are now being inserted asynchronously.  #3452

* After deleting the current worktree, `magit-delete-worktree' now
  shows the status buffer for another worktree.  d9cd4611

* Added new command `magit-worktree-checkout-pull-request'.  a3d788ec

* New variable `magit-get-previous-branch-timeout' limits the amount
  of time spent in `magit-get-previous-branch'.  #3457

Fixes since v2.12.0
-------------------

* The recently added command `magit-branch-pull-request' had various
  issues concerning pull-requests referencing branches from the
  upstream repository.  #3416 #3417 #3461

* The values of diffstat sections was wrong for sections that
  represent renamed files.  66d9558f

* Time zones were not handled correctly when calculating times for
  blame headings.  #3443

This release also contains other minor improvements, bug fixes, typo
fixes, and documentation fixes.
